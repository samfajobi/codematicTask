An API Endpoint to return the current time in the requested time zone


API Documentation 
The localTimeZone REST API demonstrates the API builder capabilities in postman. It provides an endpoint which when hit, it returns the current time in the requested african time zone.

Getting Started
To start sending requests to the localTimeZone REST API, type in any of the six african time zones you would like to know the current time for, for example  CVT, GMT, CAT, EAT, MT, WAT.
Note: If you try to type in a time zone outside these six or in lower case, you will get an error message "The time for the time zone you have entered is not available".
